## Oh hello! 

I'm Fonti and I am an evolutionary biologist wearing R developer shoes. I work with researchers and turn their ideas into accessible tools. I like to learn new things in R and sharing it with others. I am one of the organisers for the [R-Ladies Sydney Chapter](https://rladiessydney.org/) and founder of [UNSWcodeRs](https://unsw-coders.netlify.app/) - a student and staff run R user community at the University of New South Wales.
