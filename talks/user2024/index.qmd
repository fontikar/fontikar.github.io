### About the conference

The annual useR! conference, organized by R community volunteers, and supported by the R Foundation showcases applications and developments of R Software. It also features updated R packages, highlighting the boundless functionality provided by community contributions. 

### Abstract

Talk format: 5 minute lightning 

Data science is an ever-evolving industry that requires constant upskilling. The pressures to learn the latest tools for project deliverables or to enhance oneâ€™s CV can be a hindrance to effective learning. Here, I argue for the need for silliness when developing new R skills. Learning is far more enjoyable and conducive to retention and application when we take away the seriousness of upskilling. I will share my experience in creating ohwhaley - a toy R package which serves as a tool for learning package development and upskilling new learners. I hope attendees will walk away feeling more light-hearted and empowered to build silly things in R to reinvigorate their curiosity for R knowledge.
