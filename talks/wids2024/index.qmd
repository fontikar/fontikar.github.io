### About 

As part of International Women's Day 2024 celebrations, the ADSN introduced you to Australia's Rising Stars in Data Science. I was invited to join a cohort of 25 women to share our story and to inspire the next generation of young scientists and data scientists and show there is a place for gender diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.
