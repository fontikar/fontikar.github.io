### {APCalign}

The process of resolving taxon names is necessary when working with biodiversity data. 'APCalign' uses the [Australian Plant Census]() (APC) and the [Australian Plant Name Index]() (APNI) to align and update plant taxon names to current, accepted standards. 'APCalign' also supplies information about the established status of plant taxa across different states/territories.
